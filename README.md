Analysis of google playstore data
The Internet is a true gold mine of data. E-commerce and review sites are brimming with a lot of untapped data with a prominent potential to convert into meaningful insights that can help with robust decision making. Here, we explore using data science and machine learning techniques on data retrieved from one such avenue on the internet, the Google Play Store.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109526052/194060139-6d19243c-4315-45a6-8a82-b232425797ac.png)
Details of Dataset:-
The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. Actionable insights can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the Android market. The dataset is chosen from Kaggle. It is the web scraped data of 10k Play Store apps for analyzing the Android market. It consists of in total of 10841 rows and 13 columns.

The columns of the dataset are as follows:

1] App (Name)

10] Genres (Detailed Category)

11] Last Updated (App)

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK :-
Thus the app development companies could
decide what application should be developed
and they can also see the prediction of their
developed application. In this they also get to
see the categorized reviews of all the application
in one interface which will help them decide
which app is liked by the users and which apps
need to be developed more.
The dataset contains immense possibilities to
improve business values and have a positive
impact. It is not limited to the problem taken
into consideration for this project.
We could add a system that would create
application on its own by using the data set
and creating the best user interface by the highly
rated apps.
